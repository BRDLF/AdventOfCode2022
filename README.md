### Advent of Code 2022

Another year has gone by so fast, gosh.
Come to think of it, I didn't finish last year's. Got 3/4 of the way through and dropped.
I spent the latter half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 being adamant I would learn Java and not use Kotlin.
Anyways, I'm doing this year in Kotlin. (It's such a nice language...)
